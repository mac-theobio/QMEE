General
-------

For the first few weeks of the course, there will be a short assignment every week. You are advised to start on these on Monday (whether we've said exactly what the assignment is by then or not). We will typically work on them or talk about them in class during the week. They are technically due Fri at 4:30 PM. This is to encourage you to finish quickly if you can, and move on with your life, not to give you pressure. 

If your assignment will be late, please email us [bio708qmee@gmail.com](mailto:bio708qmee@gmail.com) by Friday afternoon to let us know when you will hand it in. This should be before Monday at noon, unless we give permission for special circumstances.

- The actual content of your assignment should be posted to your GitHub repo
- Submit your assignment (i.e. tell us you have finished) **by email** to [bio708qmee@gmail.com](mailto:bio708qmee@gmail.com). Your assignment is not done until you do this. To submit an assignment:

* Tell us the main file we should be looking at, including the _relative path_ from the main repo directory, e.g, `hw1/add.R`
Other files that are relevant can simply be mentioned in the script, e.g.:
* Tell us what working directory you run the script from (this will typically be either the main repo directory, or the assignment directory)
``` r
read.csv("eggplant_survey.csv")
## Plot the histotypes (see README.md)
```

Weights and rubrics
-----------

- Regular assignments will be marked on a scale of 0-3
   - 0: not submitted
   - 1: sub-standard, definitely try harder
   - 2: fine, fulfils expectations (equivalent to an A grade)
   - 3: excellent (A+)

- Assessments will be weighted as follows
   - participation (forum and in-class) 10%
   - assignments 45%
   - first draft of project 15%
   - in-class presentation of final project 15%
   - written final project 15% (you will get feedback and have a chance to make improvements between the presentation and the final submission of the written project)
