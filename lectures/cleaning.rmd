## Goals

* Introduce some principles of data management

* Introduce some practical, modern tools 

* Show some examples

## Data analysis

Data must be:

* Organized

* Cleaned

* Manipulated

* Analyzed

The first three often take the most time, and this is often because researchers undervalue them.

There's never time to do it right ... but there's always time to do it over!

## Structured tools for dealing with data

* dplyr
* tidyr
* readr

```{r tidyverse, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## A sample data set

```{r village}
villageTable <- read_csv("../data/village.csv")
```

## A sample data set

```{r villageSum.R}
summary(villageTable)
```

## A sample data set

```{r parasite}
parasiteTable <- read_csv("../data/parademo.csv")
```

## A sample data set

```{r parasiteSum.R}
summary(parasiteTable)
```

## Entering, maintaining and using data

* These are different functions, and often call for different ways of formatting data

* This is why we have computers

## Data entry 

* Convenient for users

* Some amount of redundancy is good (to catch errors)
	* Some amount of redundancy is good (to catch errors)

* Often a "wide" format (related information on the same row)

## Data use 

* Scanning for patterns and problems

* Making tables for publication

* Making data frames for statistical analysis

## Data maintenance

* Your database is
	* a logical construct
		* The core of the data that we maintain and validate
	* maybe also a software construct
		* If you are using a database program

* Data in the database is:
	* Non-redundant
	* Relational
	* Often in a "long" format (to signal values that are comparable)

## Redundancy

You don't want any redundancy in your database (although you might for entry or analysis)

* Removing redundancies is a great way to check data integrity

* Non-redundant information can be updated conveniently
	* and without introducing new errors
	* and without introducing inconsistencies

## Example

```{r}
head(parasiteTable)
```

## Tidy data

* No redundancy

* Break data into separate tables following the logic of the data

* Clear "keys" to describe the information in each row
	* Non-redundant, unique identifiers
	* Village table has village (number) as the key
	* Measurement table has id, survey as the key'

## Relational

Break data into logical tables

* Information at the level where it belongs:
	* Sampling event
	* Individual
	* Household
	* Village
	* Village group

## Tidy example

```{r echo=FALSE}
load("../data/live.RData")
sim <- as_tibble(sim)
```

```{r}
print(sim)
```

## Gathering makes things tidy

* Use long structure to mark things that are comparable, or have the same units
* `gather` has been replaced by pivot_longer

```{r}
longsim <- pivot_longer(sim, cols=!time, names_to="class", values_to="people")
print(longsim)
```

## Spreading can make things more human-readable
* `spread` has been replaced by pivot_wider

```{r}
print(pivot_wider(longsim, names_from=class, values_from=people))
```

## Flow

* Put input data into a tidy, relational form
	* Clean on the way
	* This is your database, whether you use database software or not

* Clean, maintain and merge data in the database

* Export files for analysis, presentation, etc.
	* You may wind up rebuilding files like the ones you started with
	* They are now quality-checked, and may also be easier to update

# Importing

## Summarize

* Check that numbers are numbers, dates are dates, etc.

```{r}
villageTable <- (villageTable
	%>% mutate(village=as.factor(village))
)
summary(villageTable)
```

## List

* Make lists of what occurs with what (and how many times)

```{r}
print(villageTable
	%>% group_by(vname, vu)
	%>% summarize(count = n())
)
```

## ...

* The computer is your friend

```{r}
print(villageTable
	%>% group_by(vname, vu)
	%>% summarize(count = n())
	%>% filter(count>1)
)
```

## ...

* and you always want to check yourself

```{r}
print(villageTable
	%>% group_by(vname)
	%>% summarize(count = n())
	%>% filter(count>1)
)
```

## Making relational tables

If we had data like the ```parasiteTable```, we would want to break it into

* A table at the level of people

* A table at the level of sampling events

* A table at the level of measurements

This process leads to improved clarity, __and improved cleaning__

## Parasite table

```{r}
print(parasiteTable
	%>% group_by(id, village, compound)
	%>% summarize(count=n())
)

```


## Parasite table

```{r}
print(parasiteTable
	%>% group_by(id, village, compound)
	%>% summarize(count=n())
	%>% group_by(id)
	%>% summarize(count=n())
	%>% filter(count>1)
	%>% arrange(desc(count))
)

```

## Explore ranges

```{r pophist.R}
print(ggplot(villageTable, aes(x=population))
	+ geom_histogram()
)
```

## Explore ranges

Show figure again?

# Correction tables

## Mistakes
Let's say you find an obvious error in your data

```{r echo=FALSE}
ctab <- (data.frame(
	country=(c("Kenya", "Uganda", "Ungada", "Vietnam"))
	, continent=(c("Africa", "Africa", "Africa", "Asia"))
	, count=(c(23, 31, 1, 16))
))
print(ctab)
```

How should you fix it?

## A table

A table:

* respects the original data
* records your decision
* is transparent to yourself and others
* __fixes the mistake again, if it happens again__

```{r echo=FALSE}
	cortab <- data.frame(country="Ungada", patchcountry="Uganda")
	print(cortab)
```

* Make a csv with an editor or spreadsheet program

## Patching

* Fix the problem as far "upstream" as possible

* Not the count table (as I'm doing here)

```{r}
patchTab <- (ctab
	%>% left_join(cortab)
)
print(patchTab)
```

## ...

```{r echo=FALSE}
print(patchTab)
```

## NA logic is scary

NA means "Something I don't know". You don't get the answers you expect if you compare things to NA:


```{r}
"Jonathan" == NA
```

## Finish the patch, being careful


```{r}
ctab <- (patchTab
	%>% mutate(country=ifelse(is.na(patchcountry), country, patchcountry))
	%>% select(-patchcountry)
)
print(ctab)
```

## Be careful-er

```{r}
ctab <- (patchTab
	%>% mutate(country=ifelse(is.na(patchcountry), country, 
		as.character(patchcountry)))
	%>% select(-patchcountry)
)
print(ctab)
```

* Never be afraid to break pipes up or put them back together.

## Factors

* R likes to convert characters to factors

* Factors can be useful, but they're more often weird

* Be aware of this as a possible problem

* The more you use tools from the tidy family, the less this will happen

## Dictionary tables

* You might want to summarize a factor variable into categories that you define

* In this case you could use a similar table (Ungada $\to$ Uganda), but different logic
	* You only want to keep the new version
	* ... and check for cases where the original is not matched

## Making dictionaries

```{r echo=FALSE}
religTab <- (
	read.table("../data/religion_basic.ccsv"
		, sep=":", strip.white=TRUE, header=FALSE
		, stringsAsFactors=FALSE, na.strings=""
	)
	%>% as_tibble()
	%>% transmute(category=V2, code=V1)
)
```
Print out all the codes for a particular variable, and see what you think of them

```{r}
print(religTab
	%>% select(code)
	%>% distinct()
)
```

## Coders can be funny
```{r}
print(religTab
	%>% select(code)
	%>% distinct()
	%>% filter(grepl("^M", code))
)
```

## Build a dictionary

You should start by editing the output from your previous step

```{r}
print(religTab)
```

## Using a dictionary

Start the same way as before.

```{r echo=FALSE}
churchTab <- data.frame(
	person = c("Ntombikayise", "Gao Zhong", "Mafalda", "Bill")
	, religion = c("Mulsim", "Anglican", "Angler", "Roman catholic")
)
print(churchTab)
```

```{r}
patchTab <- (churchTab
	%>% left_join(religTab, by=c("religion"="code"))
) %>% print()
```

### ...

```{r echo=FALSE}
print(patchTab)
```

## Dictionary replacement

But use different logic for replacement

```{r}
catTab <- (patchTab
	%>% mutate(religion=category)
	%>% select(-category)
) %>% print()
```

## Play with your data

* Don't touch the original data
* Make scripts and make sure that they are replicable
* Don't be afraid to play, experiment, probe
* You want to like your data-manipulation tools, and get your data as clean as possible

## Summary

* Let the computer serve you
	* Input in the form that you want to input
	* Manage in the tidy form that is efficient and logical
	* Output in the way you want to output

* Be aggressive about exploring, questioning and cleaning
