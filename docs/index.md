## Current

### Each week:

* A brief project report by email on Friday; let us know if you have any questions we can address

### Presentations

Mon 3 April and Wed 5 April

* Let us know if you want to request a day or time
* Your presentation should take 10 minutes or less: try to keep it clear and simple
* Don't over-prepare; the presentation should be an informal overview and progress report
	* Don't let the presentation preparation interfere with the actual project
	* Don't even start preparing your presentation until the Wed or Fri before (depending on when you are presenting)

### Final project

* Email us to tell us when it's time to look
