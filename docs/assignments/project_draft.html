<p>Please write up a <em>short</em> (1-2 paragraph) proposal for a group project in biological data analysis and post it to the <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3ae5bc4646fdd24b209ebcd76e98a98977%40thread.tacv2/project%2520descriptions?groupId=f81633df-ce5f-48f1-81b3-bedfdab309ab&amp;tenantId=44376307-b429-42ad-8c25-28cd496f4772">“project descriptions” channel on Teams</a> by Monday at noon.</p>
<p>Your project should focus on the biological questions you want to answer, and the data that you have to answer them with; it can say a little about the quantitative/statistical techniques you will use, if you already have ideas in that direction.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have data to use, it must be shareable at least with the instructors and with other students working on your project (and you must be able to share the <em>results</em> of your analysis with the whole class)</li>
<li>If you don’t have access to any data (yet), or your data are sensitive/private, you can:
<ul>
<li>try to get similar data from a colleague, or from a published analysis</li>
<li>structure your problem around a simulation analysis, i.e. construct randomized ‘data’ that will help you understand whether/how a particular set of statistical techniques actually works when analyzing data with a given effect size and noise level</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The more interesting and engaging your writeup is, the more likely that someone else will want to work on your data with you. If you do <strong>not</strong> want to work on the question that you proposed, please state that clearly in your proposal.</p>
<p>This is supposed to be an initial draft/set of ideas; you’re not required to do the project you describe here (e.g. if it turns out to be infeasible, or something else ends up being more interesting).</p>
<p>Feel free to reach out to the instructors (in a timely manner) if you want to clarify the parameters of the assignment.</p>
<p>We will assign you to groups based on interests and make recommendations about which of the proposals from that group are the most feasible and appropriate for this course.</p>
