<li><p>MMV is a viral infection that can cause a serious disease (called MMD)</p></li>
<li><p>MMD patients are unable to control their natural urge to make mathematical models that attempt to describe biological phenomena</p></li>
<li><p>The rapid MMV test gives a positive result:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>100% of the time for people with the virus</p></li>
<li><p>5% of the time for people without the virus</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A certain population has a prevalence of 1%</p></li>
<li><p>You pick a person from this population at random, and test them, and the test is positive.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the probability that they have MMV?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>You learn that your friend has a positive rapid test for MMV. What do you tell them?</p></li>
