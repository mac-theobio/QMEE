Introduction
============

Currently a stub! Based on the semi-improvised tutorial on March 14th, 2024.

Goals 
===================

- Simulations are great for learning statistics

- Simulations great for figuring for common needs like power analysis.

- Simulations also can play key roles in statistical inferences (like the parametric bootatrap)
