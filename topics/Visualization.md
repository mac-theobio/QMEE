Intro
=====

We will be talking about visualizing your data, with an emphasis on
`ggplot2`, which is based on the Grammar of Graphics.

Goals
=====

-   Participants will learn to think broadly about effective uses of visualization
-   Participants will learn about the Cleveland hierarchy and research on effective visualization techniques
-   Participants will be introduced to [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org)

Resources
=========

Exercise
========

* Construct some (i.e., more than one) ggplots using your data. Discuss:
	* what you are trying to show
	* some of the choices that you have made
	* the basis for these choices (e.g., Cleveland hierarchy, proximity of comparisons, or other principles of graphical communication) 

* See the [assignment instructions](../admin/assignments.html)

You should put your code on GitHub in some form. Make sure that your code has no absolute paths, and runs from beginning to end when you restart R (use "source" so you don't skip over errors by accident).
