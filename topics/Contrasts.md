title: "Custom (planned) contrasts "
---

Goals 
===================

- One way of helping yourself (and everyone else) focus on questions like "What is the difference", is to use contrasts.

- Especially when you have complex models, with interactions between categorical predictors,  (interaction) contrasts can help focus on the important (and pre-determined) questions

- Note I will be focusing on "planned" contrasts
