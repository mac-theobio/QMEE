Introduction
------------

This week is the introduction to the main statistical part of the
course. We will be grappling with difficult, abstract questions about
what we mean by scientific and statistical inference and about
statistical philosophies.

Time spent grappling with these questions will make you a better
scientist, and will provide you a strong foundation to navigate the
various detailed questions that arise from particular questions and
approaches.

Assignment
----------

-   Answer the [MMV question](MMV.html).  Get help where you need it, but write up the answer by yourself.
-   Formulate a hypothesis about your data, and discuss how you would test it statistically.

See [the assignment page](../admin/assignments.html) to submit. For this case there are two separate assignments, so you should email us the names of two files on your repo. Don't submit in a proprietary format, like Word. Plain text is best, PDF is also OK.

## Readings

-   Please read @nuzzo_scientific_2014; @simmons_false-positive_2011; @harrell_introduction_2017 (references below).  They should not be too hard to get through. Think about your own statistical philosophy and be prepared to talk about what statistical inference means to you.

We have listed a bunch of additional readings below: feel free to dip in!
