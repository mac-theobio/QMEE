Goals
=====

-   We will discuss some principles of data management, data flow and
    reproducible research
-   Participants will continue to practice with R, and will examine
    their data and make some products

Resources

Exercise
========

* Examine the structure of the data you imported 
* Examine the data for mistakes, and to make sure you understand the R classes
* Make one or two plots that might help you see whether your data have any errors or anomalies
* Describe what sort of investigations you might do with your data, and how you might break your project into replicable components: save this in your repo as a file called `README.md`
* Make sure you know how to use `source`, `save` and `load` in R: finish a task, and then close R without saving your workspace and efficiently redo the task.
* See the [assignment instructions](admin/assignments.html)
