Introduction
------------

Bayesian statistics is a completely different paradigm for thinking
about statistics. It involves making a complete probability model for
what you think *did* happen, rather than constructing a framework to
rule out things that *didn't* happen (e.g., this result arising by
chance). It has important advantages (conceptual simplicity, power,
ability to combine information from different sources), and important
disadvantages (requires more assumptions, answers may be difficult to
find).

As a scientist you are probably well advised to take a pragmatic
approach by using whatever statistical technique seems best suited to
your problem. You are definitely well advised to make a good-faith
effort to understand the foundations (particularly the philosophical
foundations) of the methods you are using (as well as the methods your
colleagues are using, since you will have to be able to evaluate these
intelligently.

Assignment
----------

Install JAGS (and either `rjags` or `R2jags`). Use `jags` to fit a Bayesian model to your data, in some way that at least roughly makes sense. Discuss your prior assumptions, and compare your simple fit to an analogous frequentist fit.
