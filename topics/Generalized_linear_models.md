Introduction
============

Generalized linear models generalize the idea of linear models (!) by adding:

* a family (the responses don't have to be normally distributed)
* a link function (the linear predictor and the effect can be on different scales)

Like linear models, they are a very powerful set of tools depending on very specific assumptions, but at least they're more flexible than linear models.

Assignment
==========

Make a _generalized_ linear model for one or more of your hypotheses. 
Draw **and discuss** at least one of each of the following:

* diagnostic plot
* inferential plot (e.g., a coefficient plot, or something from `emmeans` or `effects`)
