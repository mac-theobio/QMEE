title: Final project
---

by **12 March**: you should

* decide which data set/which questions you are going to pursue
* pick a short name for your project (letters, numbers, and underscores only please) and create a new repository with this name; whoever creates it should invite the other people and @bbolker and @dushoff.
* upload your data (if possible)
* write a `README.md` file for your repository that says briefly what you plan to do and says where the data is/are

---

Please write up a *short* (1-2 paragraph) proposal for a group project in biological data analysis and post it to the ["project descriptions" channel on Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3ae5bc4646fdd24b209ebcd76e98a98977%40thread.tacv2/project%2520descriptions?groupId=f81633df-ce5f-48f1-81b3-bedfdab309ab&tenantId=44376307-b429-42ad-8c25-28cd496f4772) by Monday 1 Mar at __noon__.

Your project should focus on the biological questions you want to answer, and the data that you have to answer them with; it can say a little about the quantitative/statistical techniques you will use, if you already have ideas in that direction. 

* If you have data to use, it must be shareable at least with the instructors and with other students working on your project (and you must be able to share the *results* of your analysis with the whole class)
* If you don't have access to any data (yet), or your data are sensitive/private, you can:
    * try to get similar data from a colleague, or from a published analysis
	* structure your problem around a simulation analysis, i.e. construct randomized 'data' that will help you understand whether/how a particular set of statistical techniques actually works when analyzing data with a given effect size and noise level

The more interesting and engaging your writeup is, the more likely that someone else will want to work on your data with you. If you do **not** want to work on the question that you proposed, please state that clearly in your proposal.

This is supposed to be an initial set of ideas; you're not required to do exactly what you describe here (e.g. if it turns out to be infeasible, or something else ends up being more interesting).

Feel free to reach out to the instructors if you want to clarify the parameters of the assignment.

We will assign you to groups based on interests and make recommendations about which of the proposals from that group are the most feasible and appropriate for this course.
