title: Mathematical modeling virus
---

* MMV is a viral infection that can cause a serious disease (called MMD)

* MMD patients are unable to control their natural urge to make mathematical models that attempt to describe biological phenomena

* The rapid MMV test gives a positive result:

	* 100% of the time for people with the virus

	* 5% of the time for people without the virus

* A certain population has a prevalence of 1% 

* You pick a person from this population at random, and test them, and the test is positive.

	* What is the probability that they have MMV?

* You learn that your friend has a positive rapid test for MMV.  What do you tell them?
