## Current

### Each week:

* A brief project report by email on Friday; let us know if you have any questions we can address

### Presentations

Mon 3 April and Wed 5 April

* Let us know if you want to request a day or time
* Your presentation should take 10 minutes or less: try to keep it clear and simple
* Don't over-prepare; the presentation should be an informal overview and progress report
	* Don't let the presentation preparation interfere with the actual project
	* Don't even start preparing your presentation until the Wed or Fri before (depending on when you are presenting)

### Final project

* Email us to tell us when it's time to look

The last part of the schedule will be determined through discussions
with the participants. If you have suggestions or requests, let us know.
