A man is walking down a street late at night when he sees another man on
his hands and knees searching the ground around a lamppost. The searcher
explains that he lost his wedding ring, so the passerby helps him look.
After a while, he asks, "are you sure this is where you dropped it?".
The other guy says, "no, I dropped it over there. But this is where the
light is!".

We do powerful tests using the normality assumption because we can.
Also, because of the Central Limit Theorem, of course.
